# Classes
Defination : it is the user defined datatype of sv.

-> groups the heterogenous data.
  1. Properties of class : all signal Declarations.
  2. Methods of class : functions and tasks inside class

 class is bydefault automatic.
         -  New Memory for new instance
         -  use new();
hence memory is allocated with the help of "new"
New memory set for each instance

HOW TO DECLARE CLASS:
we cant write module inside class or class inside module
